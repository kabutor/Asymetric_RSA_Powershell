# Asymetric_RSA_Powershell
I was browsing [Joel's PSRansom](https://github.com/JoelGMSec/PSRansom) (a ransomware emulator) were he generated a random encryption key, he obfuscate it and then send it to the C2, and I thought it will be a better ransomware simulation if even if you can see the code that generate and exfiltrate the encryption key, you couldn't get the encryption key.

For that you have to use asymetric encryption, generate a private key, and a public certificate, load that public certificate on the windows target machine, and use it only to encrypt the ransomware encryption key. Send it to the C2 and even if the traffic is sniffed or the code is made public you can not get the key, unless you have the private key to decrypt it. That is safe on the C2.

The objective was to do in in powershell, the documentation I found about this subject is not very clear, I m trying to fix that with these document/repository.

# The Certificates

Generate the certificate using openssl, to use a certificate in windows to encrypt files you need to pass some extra options to openssl that is key usage must have either *keyEncipherment* or *dataEcipherment* (we'll pass both) and in the **Extended Key Usage** field you have to had the value "*Document Encryption*" or in the case on openssl we have to use it's numeral value "1.3.6.1.4.1.311.80.1".
We pass that using a myconfig.cnf file, find the one I used as example in this repository


```
Highlights from myconfig.cnf

keyUsage = keyEncipherment , dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = "1.3.6.1.4.1.311.80.1"
```

Generate the private key (this one never leaves our computer), and the public certificate typing (the one we send to the remote machine to encrypt information):

```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout kabu_private.pem -out kabu_cert.pem -sha256 -config myconfig.cnf -extensions v3_req
```

# Powershell
In the machine where you want encrypt something, in this case a secret key, you have to install the public certificate(*kabu_cert.pem*), you can embed it on the powershell code, it's only text at the end, or you can copy the file and read it. All the code to do that is in the **enc_rsa.ps1** file, and is as follows:
To read the file and create a certificate object:
```
$SourceCertificate = Get-Content -Path '.\kabu_cert.pem' 
$EncCert=[Convert]::FromBase64String( ($SourceCertificate)[1..($SourceCertificate.Count -2 )] -as [string] )
$cert = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate]::new($EncCert)
```

To install it into the user Certificate Vault *CurrentUser\My*:
```
$dstStore = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store "My","CurrentUser"
$dstStore.Open([System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.OpenFlags]::ReadWrite)
$dstStore.Add($cert)
$dstStore.Close
```

Once in the vault, you can see it, and take note on the *Subject* name with:
```
Get-Childitem -Path Cert:\CurrentUser\My -DocumentEncryptionCert
```

To encrypt any text (our secret key here) just pass it to the **Protect-CmsMessage** and use the **Subject** of the cert as the **-To** parameter, the output text is the one we have to exfiltrate to our C2.

# Decrypt

To decrypt the message, you just need the message on a file (*text.enc in this example*), the public cert used to encrypt (*kabu_cert.pem*) and the private key (*kabu_private.pem*), also the password used when you generate the certificates will be asked (*12345678 if you use the certs on the example*)
```
openssl cms -decrypt -in text.enc -recip kabu_cert.pem -inkey kabu_private.pem -inform PEM
```
# End

That's all, by no means I'm an expert on cryptography, if you find any problem, or something not right don't hesitate to contact me. Don't use this to do anything I wouldn't do!
